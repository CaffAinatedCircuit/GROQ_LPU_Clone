EDUCATIONAL DISCLAIMER
======================
This project contains my independent Verilog implementations of learning exercises 
loosely inspired by Groq LPU™ architecture concepts I studied from public sources.

IMPLEMENTED (My own designs):
├── plesiochronous circuits (modified timing)
├── flit synchronization (custom packet format)  
├── learning modules (omitted MAC arrays, tensor scheduler, weight preload, RISC-V, software control)

ENGINEERING PROCESS:
✅ 100% open source tools (Yosys, OpenLane, Verilog)
✅ Clean-sheet design from my understanding
✅ Modified components (packets, sync methods) for learning
✅ Omitted proprietary elements intentionally
✅ FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY

NO WARRANTY - Educational exercises "as-is".
